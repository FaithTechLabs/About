# FaithTech LABS Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
FaithTech LABS, pledge to make participation in
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Being friendly and patient
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Trying to understand why we disagree
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

FaithTech is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behaviour and is expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any individual for other behaviours that we deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Our Faith

FaithTech will always be grounded in our faith and beliefs. We are created to do good works.

> For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.
> [Ephesians 2:8-10 NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/EPH.2.8-10)

Because of our beliefs we will always be open and loving:

> Do everything in love
> [1 Corinthians 16:14 NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1co.16.14)

> This is my command: Love each other.
> [John 15:17 NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jhn.15.17)

> We love because he first loved us.
> [1 John 4:19 NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1jn.4.19)

Faith is a journey and we want to support you wherever you are on that path. We want to help Christians deepen their faith while doing good. We understand if you do not share our beliefs and still welcome you to join us.

We will not harass you, but some of our activities may make you feel uncomfortable. You may find our community is not for you and that is okay.

Should you participate in our community we will share our hope, prayers, worship and beliefs with you. These are not meant to discriminate and exclude, but instead to help support our community and deepen their faith.

Unless otherwise stated, we are not here to debate or defend our beliefs. If you would like to do so we will happily connect you with a local church or more appropriate venue.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour — or have any other concerns — please report it by contacting us via [conduct@faithtech.com](mailto:conduct@faithtech.com). All reports will be handled with discretion.

In your report please include:

* Your contact information.
* Names (real, nicknames, usernames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.
* Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please include a link.
* Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, a FaithTech representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
